Notation: <dir>   - path to this directory

This is a brief list of the files in this directory.

Miscellaneous:
    README.first_tie		this file
    first_tie.tie			a copy of the source tie file
    first_tie.tppout               Output of running the .tie file through
                                the TIE preprocessor
    first_tie.tdb			Binary file containing the TIE extension 
				description.  This is the file that gets 
				uploaded to the Xtensa Processor Generator.
    default-params		default param file to configure software tools
    first_tie-params		param file to configure software tools for first_tie.tie
    first_tie.area			Area estimate for the TIE extensions
    first_tie.report		A useful report on various properties of your
				TIE description

Design Compiler or RTL Compiler Synthesis:
    first_tie.v			Verilog source file for TIE extensions
    run_syn.pl			Perl script to invoke synthesis flow

Formal Verification:
    verify			Subdirectory supporting formal verification
    verify/src/verify_sem.v	Verilog source generated from semantics
    verify/src/verify_ref.v	Verilog source generated from operation or reference
    verify/verplex		Scripts and Makefile to run Incisive Conformal
				formal verification tool from Cadence 

Xtensa tool support:
    libisa-first_tie.so		dynamically linked library used by all software tools
    libcc-first_tie.so		dynamically linked library for the compiler (xt-xcc)
    libcas-first_tie.so		dynamically linked library for the simulator (xt-run)
    libcas-ref-first_tie.so	dynamically linked library for the simulator (xt-run)
				this file is only created if the TIE compiler is invoked
				with the "-reflib" flag.

                                All the .so files are in the directory named lib-xxx/
                                where "xxx" is based on the operation system.  This 
                                directory also contains the corresponding .o files.
				
    first_tie.h			Macro definitions of the new TIE instructions.
                                This file is in the include/xtensa/tie/ directory.


To compile your application for Xtensa:
    - add "--xtensa-params=<dir>" to the command line or add the environment 
      variable 'XTENSA_PARAMS=<dir>; export XTENSA_PARAMS"
    - include the "xtensa/tie/first_tie.h" file in your C application header file
    - compile your application using xt-xcc


To estimate the impact of your TIE description on Xtensa speed and area:
  NOTE: This flow is not available for Windows build.
    - Setup your shell environment to run Synopsys Design Compiler or Cadence RTL Compiler
    - locate and edit CadSetup.file and Xttop.ioc files to specify library specific
      parameters and unique timing constraints, respectively (see TIE user guide for details).
    - Run synthesis from your tdk directory:
            "run_syn.pl -xda <target xda directory> [optional flags]"
	    (Note: run with the -help option first to see all possible synthesis tool options)
    - cd into the generated syn* output directory
    - Make sure there are no errors in the "TIE_compile.log" file.
    - Inspect the synthesis results (see TIE user guide and/or Hardware User's Guide 
      for explanation of results).


If you have the Incisive Conformal tool from Cadence, you can run this formal 
equivalence checker to compare the operation/reference description of
your instructions against their semantic descriptions by doing the following:
    - "cd <dir>/verify/verplex; make"
